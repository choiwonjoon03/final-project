Brain Tumor Classification Project
Overview
This project focuses on classifying brain tumors based on MRI data. The dataset includes images categorized into different tumor classes, such as Benign, Malignant, Pituitary, and others. The dataset is split into Training and Testing folders, each containing subfolders for specific tumor classes.

Methods
Various classification algorithms from scikit-learn are employed, including Perceptron, Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Support Vector Machines, K-Nearest Neighbors, and Gaussian Process Classification.

Optimization
To improve accuracy:

Train models using the training dataset.
Evaluate accuracy on the test dataset.
Optimize hyperparameters for enhanced performance.
